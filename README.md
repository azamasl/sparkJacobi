This is the source code for a project that I did for the Mobile Networks class offered here at NYU back in 2017. 
I basically improved on the naive implementation of Jacobi method in Sparked and test them on NYU's Hadoop cluster. Additionally I compared the Spark implementation vs. C+MPI/OMP implementation of the same method.

For further information please refer to the report.pdf.
